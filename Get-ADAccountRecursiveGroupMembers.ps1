        Get-ADAccountRecursiveGroupMembers
        by Michael Melone, Microsoft

        .SYNOPSIS

        This function recursively enumerates group membership of a specified Active Directory principal as well as the path
        that was taken to membership.  Additionally, all groups are returned (unlike Get-ADGroupMember).

        This function will determine if the target is a group or not - if you pass it a user account it will simply return 
        that account without membership.

        .PARAMETER SAMAccountName
        
        This is the sAMAccountName attribute of the account to be resolved.

        .PARAMETER Domain

        This is the domain of the account

        .PARAMETER SizeLimit

        This is the maximum number of members that this function will resolve, defaulted to 100.  If a group has more than
        SizeLimit members, it will respond that the "member" is the count of members of that group instead of resolving
        them all.

        .PARAMETER MembershipPath

        This is only designed for use with recursion - it is the path taken to the current account being enumerated.
