.SYNOPSIS
This function adds Defender exclusions to a GPO

.DESCRIPTION
This function works with the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module to simplify
adding Defender exclusions to group policy objects.  To use it, you can 
pass in a GPO from Get-GPO and specify the exclusion you want to add.

.PARAMETER GPO
This is a GPO from the Get-GPO or New-GPO cmdlet from the ActiveDirectory
PowerShell cmdlets.

.PARAMETER ExclusionType
This defines the type of exclusion to add.  Options are
- Extension (file extension)
- Path (folder path)
- Process (process name)
Note that no validation is performed on this input, so please validate
your configurations

.PARAMETER Exclusion
This is the string to exclude.  Examples include:
.mdf
c:\myfolder\
myprocess.exe

.EXAMPLE
$gpo = Get-GPO -Name "Defender Exclusions" 
Add-DefenderExclusionToGpo -GPO $gpo -ExclusionType Extension -Exclusion ".mdf"
