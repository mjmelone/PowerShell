<#
    Create-Mess
    .SYNOPSIS
    This script generates a ton of random files

    .DESCRIPTION
    This script generates a bunch of random files and folders in a specified directory.

    .PARAMETER ParentFolder
    The folder where the files will be created.  Default is .\

    .PARAMETER FilesToCreate
    The number of files to create.  Default is 100k

    .PARAMETER FolderRandomizationSeed
    This number is used to determine how often new folders are created and used.  For any
    file, you have roughly a 1/FolderRandomizationSeed chance that it will change directories.
    
    .PARAMETER MinSize
    The minimum size for any of the files created in bytes

    .PARAMETER MaxSize
    The maximum size for any file created in bytes
