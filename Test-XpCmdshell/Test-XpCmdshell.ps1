    Test-XpCmdshell

    .SYNOPSIS
    This script will test servers to determine if the xp_cmdshell function is enabled.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Servers with xp_cmdshell turned on may be able to be used by an attacker to execute arbitraty
    code as the SQL server service if a vulnerability exists that allows them to run arbitrary
    queries, such as a SQL injection vulnerability.  Code is executed under the context of the
    identity of the SQL server account on the SQL server itself.  If this server provides access
    or authorization to servers that the attacker does not have without leveraging the 
    vulnerability, this can provide a significant foothold for the attacker.

    To use this script, provide a list of one or more servers to the -DatabaseServers parameter.
    The identity used to execute this script must be a valid user to the database server.

    .PARAMETER DatabaseServers
    This parameter specifies one or more database servers to check to determine if xp_cmdshell is 
    enabled.

    .PARAMETER Report
    The report parameter specifies the location and name where the report will be generated.  The
    file must not already exist at that location.  If not specified, the report will be generated
    in the operating directory with a name of "Test-XpCmdShellReport.csv"

    .EXAMPLE
    To run the test on servers db1 and db2
    
    Test-XpCmdShell -DatabaseServers db1, db2

    .EXAMPLE
    To run the test on server db3 and output the report to c:\MyReport.csv

    Test-XpCmdShell -DatabaseServers db3 -Report "c:\MyReport.csv"
