	Deploy-C2Monitor
	by Michael Melone, Microsoft

	.SYNOPSIS
	This script will monitor for inbound traffic of a specified type and create events when
	traffic matching the pattern is detected.  Connections will be accepted, logged to the 
	event log, and immediately terminated.

	.DESCRIPTION
	Deploy-C2Monitor will open ports on a computer and listen for incoming connections.  When
	an incoming connection is discovered, details about that connection will be logged in an
	event log named C2-Monitor.

	.PARAMETER IPAddress
	If specified, this will listen only on the IP address specified.  If not specified, the
	script will listen on all IP addresses.

	.PARAMETER TCPPort
	This is a list of TCP ports to listen for connections on.

	.EXAMPLE
	To monitor port 12345 use the following command

	Deploy-C2Monitor -TCPPort 12345

	.EXAMPLE
	To monitor ports 10, 12, and 13 use the following command

	Deploy-C2Monitor -TCPPort 10, 12, 13

	.EXAMPLE
	To monitor port 10000 on IP address 10.1.1.1 use the following command

	Deploy-C2Monitor -IPAddress '10.1.1.1' -TCPPort 10000
